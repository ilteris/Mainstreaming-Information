MoodBox is a project attempting to reveal our common but not linguistically shared feelings in our everyday life. Our feelings change couple of times throughout the day. My aim is to create a collective system where people can share and watch these feeling patterns which are among all of us. Hopefully those actions will elevate our feelings in general.

Questions I am asking:

What if we can log our emotions over time? What if this log consists of not only our individual data but a collective log of environment we participate in. In what ways being aware of other peopleâ€™s emotions affect us? Could this collectivity create expressions we can perceive? (make us more happy, less tired etc.)

This is a processing applet that runs on moodbox. Visualization experiment.
